# chatbot-for-college-
This project aims to design a Python-based chatbot for an institution, capable of handling diverse user queries and integrating with various systems. The chatbot will offer an intuitive interface for users to access institutional information like courses, schedules, and maps. It will automate responses to common queries, freeing staff for complex issues. Available 24/7, the chatbot will enhance information accessibility and efficiency by managing high query volumes, reducing user wait times. It will integrate with systems like student information and library catalog. Continuous analysis of user queries and feedback will drive its ongoing improvement. ðŸ˜Š
